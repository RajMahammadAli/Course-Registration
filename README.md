<h1>Top 3 features of my project:</h1><br/>
<ul>
  <li><b>Course Selection:</b> Users can browse and select from a variety of courses displayed in cards. The selected courses are added to the cart, where users can review their choices.</li>
  <li><b>Real-time Validation: The application provides real-time validation to ensure that the total duration of the selected courses does not exceed 20 units. If the limit is reached, users receive feedback, preventing them from adding more courses.</b></li>
  <li><b>Duplicate Course Detection: To prevent redundancy, the app checks if a course has already been added to the cart. If a user attempts to add a course that is already in the cart, a notification is displayed, ensuring that courses are not duplicated.</b></li>
</ul>
